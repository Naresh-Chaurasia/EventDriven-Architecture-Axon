=== Circuit Breaker Implementation on API Gateway

*Why Circuit Breaker is Needed*

**YES** - Significant scope exists for circuit breaker implementation on the API Gateway in this payment platform architecture.

* **Critical Entry Point**: API Gateway handles all external traffic (POSTMAN → API Gateway → Services)
* **Financial Impact**: Payment failures require immediate protection mechanisms  
* **Service Dependencies**: 7+ downstream services can fail independently
* **Load Management**: API Gateway is ideal chokepoint for traffic control

*Key Benefits*

* **Load Protection**: Prevents cascade failures during high payment volume
* **Service Isolation**: Failed services don't impact entire platform
* **Rate Limiting**: Controls payment initiation requests per user/IP
* **Fast Failure**: Immediate response when downstream services are down
* **Automatic Recovery**: Self-healing when services recover

*Implementation Scope*

The API Gateway (port 8010) is the **perfect location** for circuit breakers because:

* Centralized traffic control point
* Already handles JWT validation and routing
* Can implement per-service circuit breakers
* Provides unified failure responses to clients
* Enables monitoring and alerting from single location
